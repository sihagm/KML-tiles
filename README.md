# KML-tiles
Python script that creates a KML tile-raster file, useful for sector plannings

Double click the file
Enter the desired name of the KML output
Enter the Latitude of the starting point (upper left corner) in decimal degrees, e.g. 46.94123
Enter Longitude of the starting point, e.g. 7.72843
Enter the spacing of one tile cell in east-west, in meters, e.g. 100
Enter the spacing of one tile cell in north-south, in meters, e.g. 100
Enter the number of tiles in east-west, e.g. 15
Enter the number of tiles in north-south, e.g. 20

Done, the KML file will be written into the folder, where your python file is - you can open it with GoogleEarth for example
